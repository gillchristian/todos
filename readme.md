<h1 align="center">TODO (td)</h1>

<p align="center">

A to-do's CLI app. Inspired on
[The Power of the TODO List](https://goo.gl/j1dQ4M) by

## Installation

**WIP** (I'm migrating it from Go to Haskell so everything is broken now)

## Usage

**WIP** (I'm migrating it from Go to Haskell so everything is broken now)

## TO-DO

- [x] `$ td` (lists today's todo/done)
- [x] `$ td last` (list previous's day todo/done)
- [x] `$ td add <todo item>`
- [x] `$ td standup` (list previous's day done & today's todo)
- [x] `$ td done` /  `$ td done [x]`
- [ ] `$ td rm` / `$ td rm [x]`
- [x] `$ td init` (instead any command just creates dir and first file if missing)
- [x] Create today's file when not found (from previous one).
- [ ] Tests :tm:
